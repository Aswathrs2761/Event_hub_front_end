# Event_Hub – Frontend

Event_Hub is a modern event management platform where users can create, update, delete, and view events. Users can purchase tickets using Stripe, receive tickets via email after successful payment, and cancel tickets with automatic refunds and email notifications.  
Admins have full control over events, users, and payments, including approving events.

This repository contains the **frontend** of the application built with **React + Vite** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**.
